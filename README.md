## Overview

AeroSight is a comprehensive solution designed to fetch, analyze, and forecast air quality data. It goes beyond simple prediction by correlating pollution levels with public health data (mortality rates) and automatically compiling the findings into a professional, easy-to-read PDF report.

This tool is perfect for environmental scientists, data analysts, public health officials, and anyone interested in understanding the complex relationship between air quality and its consequences.

## Key Features

- **📊 Dual-Model Forecasting:** Utilizes both **Facebook Prophet** (for time-series trends) and **XGBoost** (a powerful gradient-boosting model) to provide robust and comparable forecasts for key pollutants.
- **⚕️ Health Impact Analysis:** Correlates historical pollution data with mortality records to uncover potential relationships and forecast future health risks.
- **📄 Automated PDF Reporting:** Dynamically generates a modern, multi-page PDF report for each monitoring station, complete with an executive summary, forecast charts, model performance metrics, and mortality analysis.
- **🌦️ Integrated Weather Data:** Enriches the analysis by incorporating weather parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed) that significantly influence pollutant concentrations.
- **📍 Multi-Station Support:** Easily configurable to monitor and generate reports for multiple geographic locations.
- **🔧 Extensible & Customizable:** Built with a modular, class-based structure that is easy to understand and extend with new models, data sources, or report sections.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AeroSight.git
    cd AeroSight
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    The project uses a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

Before running the script, you may want to customize some settings within the main Python file (`your_script_name.py`):

- **`DATA_DIR`**: Change the directory where reports and data files are saved.
  ```python
  DATA_DIR = "/path/to/your/reports/"
